        <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>
            were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. <br>
            I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>

            I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. Ive been looking to make a 
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. <br> I signed up 
  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! <br> I enrolled shortly thereafter. <br>
  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, Ive successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup

    <h1 style="color: white; margin-left: 25px; position: relative; top: -70px;">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>
  <p style="color: white; margin-left: 25px; position: relative; top: -20px; font-size: 20px;">The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>

    I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
  for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.
